## 📰 This Week in Cloud Native
This week highlighted a strong emphasis on refining existing cloud native tools and fortifying their security posture. A significant development came from the Prometheus project, which officially moved Native Histograms out of experimental status in version 3.9.0. This change simplifies their adoption, indicating a maturation of advanced monitoring capabilities within the ecosystem. Simultaneously, CoreDNS v1.14.0 underscored the critical need for robust networking infrastructure by focusing on security hardening, introducing measures like regex length limits and Kubernetes API rate limiting to mitigate resource exhaustion risks.

Security remained a dominant theme, with several projects releasing critical updates. Sigstore Cosign, a cornerstone of supply chain security, issued multiple patches (v3.0.4 and v2.6.2) to resolve a specific security advisory, enhancing the integrity verification of container images. The container build space also saw substantial activity, with Buildah releasing numerous versions across its stable branches (v1.41.8, v1.39.8, v1.37.8, v1.33.14) to address a series of CVEs and update its `runc` dependency, reinforcing the security of the container image build process.

The observability and policy enforcement landscapes continued their rapid evolution. The OpenTelemetry Collector pushed out enhancements for data optimization, reflecting ongoing efforts to standardize and improve telemetry data handling. OpenObserve saw multiple rapid-fire releases, focusing on bug fixes and performance improvements across its logging, metrics, and dashboard functionalities. In policy, Open Policy Agent (OPA) and Kyverno both released bugfix versions, ensuring the reliability of declarative policy enforcement across cloud native environments.

Finally, the broader ecosystem saw steady progress. The Kubernetes Gateway API issued its monthly experimental update, signaling continuous development in traffic management. Dapr and Meshery delivered bug fixes and feature refinements, highlighting the ongoing work in distributed application runtimes and service mesh management. Even foundational components like CRI-O received multiple maintenance releases, ensuring stability across various Kubernetes versions.

## 💬 Community Buzz
Discussions across cloud native communities this week revolved heavily around the implications of the latest security advisories and the ongoing efforts to harden core infrastructure components. Many were also keen on the general availability of Prometheus's Native Histograms, exploring how this could impact their monitoring strategies and data granularity. The continuous stream of updates from projects like OpenObserve and Buildah also sparked conversations about release cadences and the balance between rapid innovation and long-term stability in critical tools.

## 📊 Week in Numbers
- 29 stable releases across 17 projects
- Multiple critical CVEs addressed in container build tools and supply chain security
- A major feature (Native Histograms) transitioned from experimental to stable in Prometheus
