## 📰 This Week in Cloud Native

The cloud native landscape saw significant developments this week, particularly around Kubernetes infrastructure and the burgeoning role of AI. A major announcement from the Kubernetes Steering and Security Response Committees confirmed the archival of Ingress NGINX, a critical component for many, urging users to consider alternatives like Cilium. This move underscores the importance of staying current with community-supported projects and planning for infrastructure evolution. Complementing this, Cluster API released v1.12, introducing powerful features like in-place updates and chained upgrades, enhancing the declarative management of Kubernetes cluster lifecycles. There were also updates on experimenting with Gateway API using `kind`, signaling continued innovation in Kubernetes networking.

Security remains a paramount concern, with a critical blog post highlighting a Kubernetes telemetry feature that could fully compromise clusters, emphasizing the need for rigorous security practices. In policy, AWS's open-source policy language, Cedar, joined the CNCF as a Sandbox project, offering a new tool for fine-grained authorization. Projects like Falco, Kyverno, OPA, and Trivy also released updates, reinforcing the community's commitment to robust security and policy enforcement within cloud native environments. Chainguard's EmeritOSS initiative further highlighted efforts to provide security and sustainability for critical, sometimes orphaned, open-source projects.

The intersection of AI and cloud native continues to be a hotbed of innovation. The Volcano community announced Kthena, a new sub-project dedicated to LLM inference for the cloud native era, showcasing efforts to integrate large language models into existing cloud native workflows. This trend extends to various aspects of development and operations, with tools like Gemini CLI integrating into agentic development loops and discussions around securing AI pipelines, particularly with Google Cloud tools for Vertex AI. The concept of "AI agents" is gaining traction, with a focus on how they can streamline software development, incident management, and even SRE tasks, though questions around managing secrets and the overall impact on developer roles are actively being debated.

Beyond core infrastructure and AI, the developer experience and community growth were also in focus. Insights into organizing KCD Sri Lanka 2025 demonstrate the global expansion and grassroots efforts within the CNCF community. Reflections on k0s's growth in 2025 highlighted the importance of community and governance. Discussions around "developer fatigue" and the emergence of "forward-deployed engineers" point to an evolving landscape where platforms are adapting to improve developer productivity. Furthermore, AWS announced increased payload sizes for serverless services up to 1MB, providing more flexibility for cloud applications. In the broader cloud market, the financial performance of major players like Microsoft and SAP saw shifts, with investor reactions tied to cloud growth outlooks and the perceived impact of AI.

## 💬 Community Buzz

The Hacker News community was abuzz with the Kubernetes Ingress NGINX archival, with many discussions revolving around the implications and necessary migration strategies. A significant amount of conversation also centered on AI agents, from their potential to revolutionize development and operations to critical questions about managing secrets, ensuring security through sandboxing, and their long-term impact on developer careers. Beyond AI, there was lively debate on Kubernetes operational patterns, including the merits of running PostgreSQL on Kubernetes versus VMs, and the emergence of new open-source DevOps control planes and tools aimed at simplifying Kubernetes environments.

## 📊 Week in Numbers
- 29 stable releases across 13 projects
- Kubernetes Ingress NGINX, a critical component for about half of cloud native environments, is being retired.
- AWS serverless services now support payloads up to 1MB.
