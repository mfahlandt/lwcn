## About Last Week in Cloud Native

**Last Week in Cloud Native (LWCN)** is a weekly newsletter dedicated to keeping the Cloud Native community informed about the latest releases, news, and developments in the CNCF ecosystem.

### Our Mission

We believe staying current with the rapidly evolving Cloud Native landscape shouldn't require hours of research. LWCN distills the most important updates from across the ecosystem into a concise, actionable weekly digest.

### Who We Are

LWCN is curated by **Cloud Native practitioners** with hands-on experience in:

- **Kubernetes Operations** - Managing production clusters at scale
- **CNCF Projects** - Contributing to and implementing projects like Helm, ArgoCD, Prometheus, and more
- **Platform Engineering** - Building internal developer platforms using Cloud Native technologies
- **DevOps & GitOps** - Implementing CI/CD pipelines and GitOps workflows

### Our Methodology

Every week, we follow a systematic approach to curate the most relevant content:

#### 1. Release Monitoring
We track **100+ CNCF and Cloud Native projects** for new releases, including:
- Graduated projects (Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, etc.)
- Incubating projects (Argo, Flux, Linkerd, etc.)
- Sandbox projects and emerging technologies

#### 2. News Aggregation
We monitor multiple sources for Cloud Native news:
